## an animated SVG printer using a *metal-Pythag* engine

### what

Create cellular automata moving images like:

<img src="https://github.com/bestape/alchemy/blob/master/images/100by50.svg?raw=true" width="50%" >

The famous Golden Ratio, shown above, and additional [Metallic Means](https://verasmathematicworld.org/). 

<img src="https://github.com/bestape/alchemy/blob/master/images/500by50.svg?raw=true" width="50%" >

<img src="https://github.com/bestape/alchemy/blob/master/images/2000by50.svg?raw=true" width="50%" >

These images can be used, among other things, as visual clocks or a box of Infinite objects with every object observable from above. 

### use

1. Have `node.js` installed on your machine.

2. Download the `app.js` and `app.json` files; ensure `app.js` is executable.

3. Change the values in `app.json` to your preference. 

4. Run `./app.js` in your terminal.

5. Enjoy the SVG printout!

### technology

Please read `app.js`.

`app.js` uses a grammar structure I invented with inspiration from music and contract techniques. 

`app.js` is a well-woven tapestry kind of script.

To make `app.js` without being overwhelmed by the grammar's interconnections, I built it with my patent pending Hierarchical Script Database "kernel" module.

After I was done building `app.js`, I removed the kernel as if it was a loom or scaffolding used to construct and then take down when finished.

In other words, I built a Hierarchical Script Database, then I threw out the database part and published the hierarchical script end product.

[Here's a YouTube demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNc1jQLnX4&list=PLL0gyjXno6eihH_BNd5rtpglSyJnsgk5P) of an app that retains its Hierarchical Script Database kernel & structure during runtime:

### why

I define code (function, verb) as data (object, noun) with the potential to produce an Infinite stack of unique input-output data.

I do this so that I can define a module as a subject and write complete sentences -- computational prose -- in JavaScript.

This means that a torus's point-at-Infinity loop-around cannot fixate my definition of code because it repeats itself.

Instead, this repository uses a *metal-Pythag* point-at-Infinity loop-around I invented that can fixate my definition of code.

A *metal-Pythag*'s point-at-Infinity loop-around has a finite modulo sequence (rotation), like a torus does.

However, unlike a torus, a *metal-Pythag*'s point-at-Infinity loop-around also has a positive & negative Infinite number-line sequence (recursion).

This positive (forward) & negative (backward) number-line exists as an exponent of a scale-symmetry base and provides the Infinite stack index for my definition of unique input-output data.

### problem & opportunity 

Phenomenologically, the irrational number of a right triangle diagonal like `2^( 1 / 2 )` is not so much irrational Nature as it is a non-halting *anthyphairesis* process.

When measure is intended to reconcile an irrational number with a rational unit, the non-halting process of the irrational number means it's incommensurate unless approximate.

In this context, without a [Euclidean algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm#/media/File:Euclidean_algorithm_1071_462.gif) *greatest common divisor*, an irrational number is problematic because its measure is inaccurate compared to rational numbers.

However, when measure is intended to perpetuate an ongoing sequence, an irrational number's non-halting process is an invaluable engine.

### how

The non-halting property of a right triangle diagonal is not limited to the diagonal.

By removing the orthogonal lengths of a right triangle from its diagonal, the remaining value is the non-halting part.

This non-halting part is the scale-symmetry base & exponent recursion of a rectangle of a particular resonance.

This rectangular resonance zig-zags between positive and negative exponents. 

For a `( a^2 + b^2 )^( 1 / 2 )` diagonal, the non-halting part is `(c - b) / a` and the resonating rectangle is `( a^2 + ( 2 * b^2 ) )^( 1 / 2 )`.

* The function as an object is `( a^2 + ( b + c )^2 )^( 1 / 2 )`; 

* the function as an action is `( c - b ) / a`; 

* the input-output data as an object is `( a^2 + ( 2 * b )^2 )^( 1 / 2 )`; and

* the unique identifier of an input-output data object is `( ( c - b ) / a )^n`.
