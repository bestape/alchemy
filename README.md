## an animated SVG printer using a *metal-Pythag* engine

### what

Create cellular automata moving images like:

<img src="https://github.com/bestape/alchemy/blob/master/images/100by50.svg?raw=true" width="50%" >

The famous Golden Ratio, shown above, and other [Metallic Means](https://verasmathematicworld.org/).

<img src="https://github.com/bestape/alchemy/blob/master/images/2000by50.svg?raw=true" width="50%" >

These images can be used, among other things, as visual clocks or a box of Infinite objects with every object observable from above. 

[This blog post](https://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/1719229) explores other potential uses, including many beyond the scope of this repository. 

### do

1. Have `node.js` installed on your machine.

2. Download the `app.js` and `app.json` files. Ensure `app.js` is executable.

3. Change the values in `app.json` to your preference. 

4. Run `./app.js` in your terminal.

5. Enjoy the SVG printout.

### why

The irrational number of a right triangle diagonal like `sqrt2` is not so much irrational nature as it is a non-halting *anthyphairesis* process.

When measure is intended to reconcile an irrational number with a rational unit, the non-halting process of the irrational number means it's incommensurate unless approximate.

In this context, without a Euclidean algorithm *greatest common divisor*, an irrational number is problematic because its measure is inaccurate compared to rational numbers.

However, when measure is intented to perpetuate an ongoing sequence, an irrational number's non-halting process is invaluable.

### how

The non-halting property of a right triangle diagonal is not limted to the diagonal.

By removing the orthogonal lengths of a right triangle from its diagonal, the remaining value is the non-halting part.

This non-halting part is the scale-symmetry base & exponent recursion of a rectangle of a particular resonance.

This rectangular resonance zig-zags between positive and negative exponents. 

For a `( a^2 + b^2 )^( 1 / 2 )` diagonal, the non-halting part is `(c - b) / a` and the resonating rectangle is `( a^2 + 2b^2 )^( 1 / 2 )`.
